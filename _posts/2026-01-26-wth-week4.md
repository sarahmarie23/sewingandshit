*THESE CONTACTS WTFFF!!! Oh, and if Xal had a Myspace, this pic could definitely have been on it. I can confirm this because I had something similar.*

## 🧵 Shit I Did

- Filled in gaps and sanded in some new decorative gaps on the pauldrons.
- Received contacts and did another makeup trial.
- Tried dyeing some tights. I say "tried" because it kind of worked, but then I ripped them.
- Experimented with sanding technique for the swirlies on the upper armband piece. 
- Painted the ears skin tone and then put the body paint on top.

## 🧠 Shit That Lived in My Head

- I can't wear these contacts for very long! They will have to be saved for special occasions (cosplay contest, meeup, pro photoshoots).
- Good thing I ordered some "regular" contacts too. 
- Time that I spend doing things like playing video games could be spent working on cosplay.

## 🔮 Thoughts for Future Work

- I think I have the base and skincare routine down, but I still want to experiment with highlight and contouring.
- Get some higher denier tights because durability is more important than looking real.
- I should really get on the sewing stuff. I think I hold off on those parts because it's something I'm more familiar with, therefore filter seems like it should be easy to do. But I should get it done to help build momentum.

## 📋 TODO — Next Week

- Finish the ears.
- Finish the upper pauldrons.
- Draft a pattern for the top/vest.
- Continue working on the arm band.
- Start sanding work on the lower pauldrons.

## 📸 Photo Dump

![Dye Process](/assets/images/wth/20260119_dye.jpg)
*This didn't go according to plan. I ordered the thinnest tights possible, they tore in multiple places. After leaving them in for an hour I was able to get a color that was good enough, so the plan is to try again with some thicker tights. By the way, the color is WAY lighter after the tights are dry and stretched out!*

![Arm Piece WIP](/assets/images/wth/20260125_arm-piece.jpg)
*I wanted to try something simple and practice this technique. I first used a knife to carve out a v-shaped groove, then went over it with a small sanding cylinder to even out the edges.*

![Ears with Paint](/assets/images/wth/20260125_ears-paint.jpg)
*Next step: painted the ears human colored, with my logic being that I can use my makeup and seal that. You might also noticed that I forgot to drill out the earrings last week. I'm going with the 6 instead of 7 (that's a conversation for another blog...) and I have those wires cut and ready to paint.*

![Pauldron Top Sanded](/assets/images/wth/20260125_pauldron-top-sanded.jpg)
*Legit excited to see these painted, looking badass. I had fun making the texture. This is only the smaller top part of the pauldrons so we're going to look stupidly ridiculous but void as fuck when the whole piece is complete.*
