## Scene

> “That bow is SICK.”

> I turned my head as a teenage boy said that to his friend, and I smirked a little. This wasn’t my first encounter with my fans that weekend. Yes, I said *my* fans. It felt like I was the popular girl in school. Almost like a celebrity. It wasn’t what I expected. And that was only the beginning.

## Before the Con

This is what you would've seen walking down the street, riding the subway, stopping for lunch before stepping through a portal into another dimension: the Seattle Convention Center. 

Just a regular human - on the outside. But inside? I was me. And what everyone else saw, was Ashe, a champion ready to fight on Summoner’s Rift. 

Remember that - because later, that sentiment would change.

## The High

Here are some of the things I heard over the weekend:
* "How heavy is that bow?!" (me: proceeds to hand it over so they can try)
* "I love your cosplay, can I get a picture?"
* "Ashe!!!"
* "My roommate is such an Ashe fan, can I get a picture?"
* *Shouting from a car window rolled down* "I like your costume, you look great!"
* "Are you from WoW *(World of Warcraft)*?" (I guess I must’ve looked close enough for the con's cosplay bingo card. But seriously...*do I look like I’m Alliance to you?*)
* *From professional photographers* "Do you mind if I get some pictures?"
* *From a child walking by at the bow twice his size* "WHOAA!"

All weekend, I was in a constant state of being seen.

## How It Changed Me

The attention was - *not gonna lie* - a huge confidence boost. I’ve been to several ren fairs, where everyone's dressed up. You fit in. 

But here, I stood out. People actually recognized (somehow) or just thought I looked awesome enough to say something. I knew, early on: I HAD to do it again.

I started planning for the next con. And then the one after that.

I’m even going to practice acting - my cosplay weakness. I can *look* amazing, but I need to study how these characters behave and speak. It's tricky when I don’t actually play the games my characters are from.

## Now

I’ve got plans. I’m learning a new skill: 3D printing. And now I’m making this big-ass gun.

I’m becoming Ashe. Again. But this time from Overwatch. The name is just a coincidence - but I like her story. I vibe with her.

## Final Thoughts

Up until 2025, I didn’t really consider myself a cosplayer. I made some things. I tried a few times. I rarely finished.

But this time? Something clicked.

I’m not sure if I’ve earned the title yet - but I want it. I’m building the skills. I’m showing up. I’m learning.

Maybe being a cosplayer doesn’t start when you finish your first costume. Maybe it starts the moment you decide to do it again.
