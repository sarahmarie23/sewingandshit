## Intro

I’m more than a month late writing this, but better late than never. This will be a shorter post, just the highlights, what I wore, and some little thoughts I had.

## Highlights

I don’t have a ton of photos. Just a selfie, a couple shots with my friend, and that cape moment. But honestly, the best part was just soaking in the atmosphere. I absolutely love seeing what everyone else is wearing. I enjoy putting my phone away and listening to the music, the vendors, navigating through the hordes of people as I follow the scent of turkey legs (yumm). It's not about getting a bunch of insta-worthy shots and videos. Rather, just be there and be one with the crowd.

## What I Wore

I ended up wearing my League of Legends Ashe costume, minus the wig and hood. Ren faires are outside, and its too warm for that.Also, I traded Ashe's big ass bow for a regular working bow that I had received as a gift. Note: real weapons *are* allowed at the Ren Faire! But by look also included a pair of elf ears. I’ve always wanted to wear elf ears to the Ren Faire and this felt like the perfect excuse. It turns out that elf ears are in; I saw them everywhere! They worked well enough for this look. I thought about reusing them for my next cosplay and just painting them over, but I have something else in mind.

And of course, with Ashe comes the cape. I got a photo of me walking with it fluttering in the wind and honestly… I think I’m a cape person now. They’re just so much fun to wear. Bonus discovery: unlike at a convention, there’s no cosplay repair booth at the Ren Faire. Whatever you wear has to survive the day on its own.

## Closing Thoughts

It was a good day, and I’m glad I finally wore elf ears at a Ren Faire. Capes are officially on my list of must-wear items going forward. Looking forward to next year! This event made me excited for the next event, PAX West, which was only a few weeks after the Ren Faire.

Okay and I have to point out: unlike ECCC and PAX, *nobody* pointed me out as Ashe. They liked my outfit, but I threw everone off with the elf ears. Instead, I got asked if I was a Windrunner (sisters Alleria and Sylavana) from WoW. There was the cutest little girl who said "She looks like she's from WoW!" and I won't forget that moment. As a WoW fan (and yes, those elf ears were modeled after the blood elves) I *do* have a WoW cosplay in the works. But it just gets me thinking: is a Windrunner cosplay in my future?

**I'm considering it.**
