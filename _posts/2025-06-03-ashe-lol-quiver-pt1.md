# We need an Upgrade!

Building Ashe's quiver was the next piece I would have made for my original Ashe if I had the time. I think one of the reasons why I didn't get around to making it sooner is that I had purchased a *blueprint* rather than a *pattern*. At the time, I didn't know the difference. Basically, a **blueprint** is a flat outline, while a **pattern** has pieces you can cut and piece together. With a blueprint, you're on your own with figuring out how to turn a 2D drawing into a 3D object.

This blueprint could be printed out to scale by taping several sheets of paper together.

## Learning a new skill

This was a good place to start learning how to work with blueprints. It was a relatively simple structure (just a tube with some layers on top, right?). I've referenced this 3D model website many times for this project and I did so for this piece.

## Making the base

I started with the tube. It wasn't just a straight tube, but had a curve to it. Here's the tricky part. I could trace the shape from the blueprint, but forming it into a tube wouldn't shape it correctly. You need to account for some extra width for the circumference of the tube. 

## Let's think this through...or not

This was all trial and error for me. I've been described as someone who is determined, enjoys a challenge and pays attention to detail (they aren't wrong). Did it occur to me that I could use math to figure out the size of an oval given its diameter? Of course I did. But I chose not to. This was art, not a piece of engineering.

## What I learned

I cut pieces of paper for each piece and adjusted them until they fit close enough. Foam is a bit forgiving; it can be stretched and squished, within reason. The tricky part was accounting for the thickness of the foam. A flat piece of paper might fit all the way around, but once you cut it out of foam, it might not work as intended.
