*I painted the ears using the same makeup that's for my face. Which is great for getting the right color! Terrible for longevity. Still figuring out how to get it to seal.*

## 🧵 Shit I Did

- Tried to paint varnish on the ears, but the makeup was coming off.  I tried mixing the makeup into medium. This seems to stick but I only tried it on the back. 
- Worked on painting the upper pauldrons. Decided to get fancy. It's worth it. That's what I'm going to keep telling myself.
- Figured out my eyeshadow look! It even lasted through dancing so we're good.
- Tested out the contacts a few times. I can wear them 30 minutes no problem, but 45 it starts getting uncomfortable.

## 🧠 Shit That Lived in My Head

- I hope its worth the extra effort for painting the pauldrons like how I started, but it's going to take a lot of extra time.
- I didn't get done what I intended to, and that makes me nervous.
- Why am I doing this again? Why Xal'atath? Why was I drawn to her?

## 🔮 Thoughts for Future Work

- I realized that the eyebrows are pushing down on my eye and that's why I look sad or off. I knew something looked weird! So I need to try making them thinner, curved up, and maybe try gluing them higher up.
- Karaoke is this Wednesday so I have one more chance to try out the wig and makeup (okay technically I could go out to some other event but I wouldn't feel comfortable).
- GIRL START SEWING DAMNIT

## 📋 TODO — Next Week

(Same as last week)
- Finish the ears.
- Finish the upper pauldrons.
- Draft a pattern for the top/vest.
- Continue working on the arm band.
- Start sanding work on the lower pauldrons.

## 📸 Photo Dump

*Yay I can do my eyes! I might tweak it just a little bit though. I used the Mehron pictured earlier, the Gone Metal palette from Colourpop, and Two Face's Chocolate Bar*

*Why the sad face? It's the brows weighing down on my eyelids. BTW I tried this after going out at night for 5 hours. So I know the makeup works. I came home and wanted to see how it worked with the wig, brows, and contacts. It's coming togther.*

*So I intended to finish these pauldrons yesterday, buuut that never goes according to plan. Got a bit of work here but at least it's coming along!*
