## 🧵 Shit I Did

- Finished the armor band pieces.
- Finished the upper pauldrons.
- Finished a bunch of detail pieces.
- Started work on the collar and considered how to get it done.

## 🧠 Shit That Lived in My Head

- The pile of unpainted detail pieces is actually getting smaller?!
- I really wanted to finish that upper pauldron; I stayed up until 5 AM on Thursday night working on it.
- How many pockets can I hide into the fabric belts and clothing pieces? I need storage.
- After realizing what I did this week, I did more than I thought I did.

## 🔮 Thoughts for Future Work

- The ears are peeling so they need to be painted and sealed ASAP. I will try again with mixing the makeup with medium
- The Dark Heart should also be sealed soon, let's get that wrapped up.The paint is also starting to chip.

## 📋 TODO — Next Week

- Get the ears painted and sealed and finished.
- FInish bottom pauldrons.

*Looking very fancy. Needs to be glued and make some straps to keep it on.*

*I did one last in-public test with the wig and makeup.Yes, I'm wearing purple makeup here and no you can't tell because the Light wants to hide the Void.*

*I painted all this cool shading and after painting the gold border realized it was too light. I gave it a dark grey wash to tone it down.*

![Collar WIP](/assets/images/wth/20260209_collar-wip.jpg)
*I'm figuring this one out as I go along. My theory was to glue the pieces and put fabric on top, then glue the detail pieces. The problem is that this isn't the right shape and the foam needs to be heated to shape. I think everything needs to be shaped first and THEN I can glue on fabric and details.*

![Ears peeling](/assets/images/wth/20260209_ears-peeling.jpg)
*WHYYYY? They used to look so pretty. This part is so small yet one of the more frustrating pieces to make. And probably wear, now that I think about it.*
