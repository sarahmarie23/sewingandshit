# What is this 'Maker Faire?'

I remember going to the Maker Faire pre-covid, and when I'd tell people that I'd have to try and explain what it was. It's not a tech conference, its family-friendly, there's vendors selling 3D printers, startups showcasing their product, and artisans selling jewelry and soap. But I think the slogan sums up up quite well:

### "The greatest show and tell on earth."

Basically, this event brought together people who make things, so that they may share their creations with those around them. It's typically STEM related stuff, but it doesn't have to be technical, electronics, that sort of thing. You can check out people's projects on their blogs and social media, but seeing them up close is something special and inspiring. And that's what I'm taking back home with me.

## Cosplay props!

I ran into a couple different groups that make cosplay props. Honestly this was the sort of inspiration I needed to get started working on my League of Legends Ashe costume. I have some friends who want to go to Comic Con, and I want to dress up and go too. *But, I kinda need to make some progress on this costume.* Seeing these amazing works of art was that "girl, get your shit together" that I need.



## A source of *inspiration*

One of my favorite booths I stopped at was [**T & A Workshop**](https://tandaworkshop.com/), a group that made cosplay props. They are located in Petaluma, CA and offer classes (I wish I lived nearby, I would definitely sign up!)

*I saw this costume on display, and later, someone was walking around the audience wearing it!*

The work here was impressive. It wasn't just props, these were entire suits of fantasy armor and even this giant robot figure (sorry I don't play video games and can't tell you its name, but I'm a fan of it)

*This thing was huge. If it was hollow I'd be able to fit inside*

I'm planning to go to Comic Con with some friends, and we've decided to dress as League of Legends characters. There are tons to choose from, and again, I don't play the game but I think it would be a lot of fun to make and dress up for the con.

*I picked this character because I liked the look of her dress and it was more sewing (which I am proficient in) than armor building*

Reality is, I haven't made *tooo* much progress with the costume...BUT seeing these impressive works of art is what I needed to essentially get started with this project.

*I'm hoping to get all these pieces to fit on one sheet of foam.*

There was a binder sitting on the table and I started flipping through the pictures and asked about how this prop was made. And I got to hear the whole story, how they 3D scanned an action figure, enlarged the pattern, and used that to draft the pieces. I didn't even realize that was an option! They also had demonstrations on a vacuform machine which is used to make props. You can also make a mold, 3D print pieces; there are so many ways to solve this problem.

And that's what programming is all about: solving problems. Maybe hearing the phrase "solve this problem" in relation to costume creation sounds funny, but the problem one has is, how do we make it? We become makers, creators, and build something amazing together.
