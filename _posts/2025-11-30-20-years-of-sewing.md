# **20 Years of Sewing: How a Pirate Vest Started Everything**

This November marks **twenty years** since I first started sewing. I didn’t know it at the time, but one small project — a simple pirate vest I made for a friend’s 13th birthday party — would end up shaping the next two decades of my life.

It was 2005, and we were going to **Pirate’s Dinner Adventure**. I wanted something fun to wear, so I decided to make a vest. I didn’t know how to draft patterns back then, so I **traced one of my shirts** to get the basic three-piece shape. My mom had shown me how to use the sewing machine for straight and zigzag stitches, so I did what I knew: sew the seams, fold the edges, and zigzag everything down.

I found some ribbon and used it for the front lacing. Then I discovered an **eyelet punch** in my mom’s craft stash. I had no idea how to use it properly. Some of the eyelets bent, some fell out, and nothing lined up perfectly, but when I finished, I held something I had made with my own hands. And more importantly: **I was going to wear it in public**.

I don’t have a photo of that vest (I *wish* I did. Maybe it’s still buried somewhere at my parents’ house), but I do still have the **pirate hat** I bought that night. I remember standing in the gift shop debating whether to get it. Did I know I was going to go all-in on pirate costumes? That it would become a defining part of my identity? Probably not. But I bought the hat anyway, and I wore it again and again over the next several years. That hat became part of who I was long before I ever realized sewing would be too.

In September of the following year, I started high school, and I quickly became known as **the pirate girl**. I joined the school’s art academy program — just a regular high school with a multi-year art track — and *Pirates of the Caribbean* showed up everywhere in my projects. I wasn’t the sketching kid, but POTC still appeared in collages, assignments, and in the piles of magazine clippings and posters I collected for my binder and bedroom wall. Yes, my bedroom walls became covered in pirate pics. I bought every piece of merch I could get my hands on.

I made more costumes over the next few years, like **Giselle** and **Elizabeth Swann**, but back then I still didn’t think of myself as a **cosplayer**. I wasn’t performing or becoming the character. I was just **making costumes and wearing them**, like dressing up for fun. I didn’t step into a persona or act; I just loved the feeling of creating something and then putting it on.

In the art program, everyone had something they were known for — maybe you were into drawing superheroes, or a huge fan of a band. You could look at a piece of work and knew which student made it. And pirates was my thing, which led to **making costumes becoming my thing**, even though I didn’t have a word for it yet.

Now it’s twenty years later. Today, cosplay *is* my thing, but it took me a long time to feel comfortable saying that. Sewing is still the most grounding, satisfying, identity-defining part of who I am. And in the last year, everything has come full circle: my friend and I cosplayed together at **PAX**, and now we’re working on builds for **ECCC** and **BlizzCon**. She wants to get into making her own costumes, and I’ve been helping her get set up with tools and supplies — the same way my mom helped me back then.

I didn’t know, standing in that gift shop holding a pirate hat, that it would lead here. I just liked the feeling of making something and wearing it proudly. But that decision changed my life.

Here’s to **twenty years of sewing**, and to many more decades of creating, crafting, and wearing something made by hand.
