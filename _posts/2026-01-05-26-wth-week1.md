## 🧵 Shit I Did

![Pieces](/assets/images/wth/2026-01-03_pieces.jpg)
*Just some of the pieces I cut out. Many of these were cut as two layers that were glued to make them 10mm thick.*

- Combed my wig. 
- Cut out most of the foam pieces (except the corset and leg armor). 
- Glued together the 10mm pieces (pauldron). 
- Started sanding the edges for the upper pauldron.
- Recut the pauldron decorative piece. I didn't realize I needed 4 instead of 2!
- Ordered some tights that I can dye (from Calzedonia) and more purple makeup and tools (from Mehron).

## 🧠 Shit That Lived in My Head

- Found out that silver sharpies aren't that great so I bought some paint pens. They seem to work better. 
- These pauldrons are looking badass and I only have the basic shape, but they seem really big. 
- I will need to be mindful of navigating through crowds of people and possibly walking down the stairs at my apartment.

## 🔮 Thoughts for Future Work

- This is going to take a while so I need to do a little bit every day.
- Now that it's only 2 months away from ECCC, I'm feeling the pressure and stress about how much work still needs to be done.

## 📋 TODO — Next Week

- Order components and lights for Dark Heart. 
- Finish painting the Dark Heart.
- Try to get the board working for the dark heart.

## 📸 Photo Dump

![Markers](/assets/images/wth/2025-12-29_markers.jpg)
*I tried a couple of other markers besides sharpies.*

![Border](/assets/images/wth/2026-01-03_border.jpg)
*Something that will take a long time. There are many pieces like this. I cut them at the angles so that I can get nice inner bevels. So this is just the beginning.*

![Collar](/assets/images/wth/2026-01-03_collar.jpg)
*I forgot to add this to the initial pic with all the pieces, but once again I decided to go extra and I'm adding beveled trim to the front and back. And cutting them and regluing them.*
