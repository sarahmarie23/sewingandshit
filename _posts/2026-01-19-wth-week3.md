*FUCK YEAH I'm ready for Manaforge Omega now*

- I ordered a bunch of electronics components and started soldering.
- The plug on the battery was too big, so I ordered some plugs with wires to splice in.
- Temporarily put all of the Dark Heart components together. Nothing is glued down.
- HOLY SHIT I HAVE A DARK HEART (prototype...did I just make a dragon soul?)
- Sanded and glued together the pauldron edges.
- Experimented with hooks on the ears and sanded the shape.
- Made eyebrows by cutting a section of hair.

## 🧠 Shit That Lived in My Head

- This Dark Heart looks sick like ngl I'm kinda geeking out over here.
- I don't know if I would ever make more to sell but I got a couple people interested in buying one.
- I want to take a break on the Dark Heart and switch to something else. Probably want to get the clothing bits worked on next

## 🔮 Thoughts for Future Work

- I should make another pair of eyebrows as backup.
- How am I supposed to do the tattoos, will my previous method with the print and cutout version work?

---

## 📋 TODO — Next Week

- Paint the ears.
- Work on the pauldrons.
- Do another makeup test.
- Draft a pattern for the top/vest.

## 📸 Photo Dump

*FUN FACT! I wired this backwards, so don't do this! The arrow points toward where the electicity is flowing. So that's why my test light didn't work at first.*

![Pauldron WIP](/assets/images/wth/20260116_pauldron-wip.jpg)
*I cut the border up so that I could cut and sand the angles and glued them back together. More work is needed to fill in gaps and add texturing.*

![Brow WIP](/assets/images/wth/20260118_brow-wip.jpg)
*A little messy, but it works! Making brows using sections of hair and wood glue.*

![Ears Unpainted](/assets/images/wth/20260119_ears-unpainted.jpg)
*I experimented with hooks but I will also use pros aide to make them stay in place. I'll report back on that later.*
