## 🧵 Shit I Did

![WIP](/assets/images/wth/2026-01-07_cover.jpg)
*Holy shit it's actually starting to look like a Dark Heart.*

- I got the Dark Heart screen to print "Hello world"!!! 
- Fabric haul from A&A textiles in Fresno, CA. I got the last of the needed fabric (lining, fabric to use for the wraps) plus fabric for additional projects.
- I worked on more sanding and painting the foam detail pieces.
- Decided to make a real corset to wear underneath everything. I needed something since the chunky corset thing will be made of foam.
- THE DARK HEART CAN DISPLAY A STILL IMAGE FUCK YES

---

## 🧠 Shit That Lived in My Head

- The Dark Heart looks badass even with just a still screen and no LEDs.
- Why do I need so many layers of paint for the detail pieces?! I'm trying to do it right, it's just tedious as hell.
- Makeup is hard. I'm stressing out because I can't seem to get it right. It's too dry and cakey and I can't get the colors to blend well.
- How am I supposed to hold the Dark Heart as I walk around?

## 🔮 Thoughts for Future Work

- I'll save the Dark Heart animation for BlizzCon and just use a still image for ECCC.
- I will add LEDs though. And probably make them animated.

---

## 📋 TODO — Next Week

- Figure out how to do LEDs for the Dark Heart.
- Practice makeup.
- Ears. I think it will help me with the makeup if I had the relevant pieces done.
- Keep painting all of the detail pieces.

*This is the board I'm dealing with, the **Waveshare ESP32-S3 LCD 2.8C**.*

*First step was to make sure the board was working. The backlight can be turned on without the use of libraries, so we had to get that going first before adding more.*

*Then I was able to add in the LVGL library and do a simple color test.*

![Hello World](/assets/images/wth/2026-01-06_hello-world.jpg)
*As per coding tradition, I needed to output "Hello World".*

*Finally, a still image can be displayed!*
