Every researcher includes a "Works Cited" or "Sources" or "Bibliography" at the end of their written work. Today I will do the same. I'd like to share where I got everything for this costume, and give credit to the people and places that helped me out.

## Fabrics

**Main costume fabric** - Since I was in southern California during the winter break, I just had to make a trip to the LA Fabric District. There are so many stores, and the experience can be very overwhelming to some people. I stuck with one shop that, according to my research, should carry everything I needed. And that was **Michael Levine Fabrics**. It's recommended as a one-stop shop, not the cheapest but I was reasonably able to get what I needed. I bought several yards each of the navy blue fabric and gold fabrics I used for the accents. They had a stretchy gold fabric that I used for most of the gold parts, and I couldn't resist this goam gold fabric that I used for the hood. Additionally, I bought some inner and outer white fabrics for the corset.

Michael Levine also has an extensive notions and trims section. I picked up some ribbon for the corset lacing and my badge lanyard, and a few sets of bra cups for some projects I have in mind.

You can probably find most of what you need here! And the employees are friendly too. I highly recommend this place if you are in the LA area. I checked an extra bag full of materials to bring home with me.
