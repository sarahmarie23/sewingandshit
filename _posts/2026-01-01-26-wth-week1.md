## 🧵 Shit I Did

![cape](/assets/images/wth/2025-12-30_cape.jpg)
*The cape is essentially done! Will need to glue down the flaps to the hooks and optionally paint the chain.*

- Finished off cape hooks (paint and seal), attached to cape flaps. 
- Finished off the set of decorative foam for the purple flap. 
- Cut out a good chunk of foam for the rest of the foam pieces.

## 🧠 Shit That Lived in My Head

- I used up 2 whole sheets of foam and still need more.

- Silver sharpie for tracing foam is a game changer.

- Painting on multiple layers is so tedious! Mod Podge x2, black paint x2, gold paint x2 or as needed, varnish (x2 on front, x1 on back). You're supposed to wait at least 24 hours for the paint to dry before varnish, and then 24 hours between layers.

## 🔮 Thoughts for Future Work

- Continuously work on the decorative pieces. Even if I'm not currently working on that specific piece, the decorations take a long time to paint all the layers. 

- It helps to work on a task instead of just one piece at a time (example: I'm cutting out all the foam. I'll probably cut out the fabric all at once).

## 📋 TODO — Next Week

- Finish cutting out foam. 

- Measure leg armor piece (probably need to shorten). 

- Start dremel work on pauldrons.

## 📸 Photo Dump

*I've been using regular sharpies and pens, not sure why I never just got the bright ass sharpie so I can actually see what I'm doing.*
