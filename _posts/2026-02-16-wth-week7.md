![Collar almost finished](/assets/images/wth/20260216_collar-almost-finished.jpg)

*Just need to finish this collar and decide on how to attach it. I'm thinking velcro'd to the upper edge of the vest/top.*

## 🧵 Shit I Did

- Finished painting all of the detail pieces.
- Almost done with the collar (just need to paint and varnish the edge).
- Used foam clay to fill in the gaps of the lower pauldrons.
- Touched up the paint and varnished the Dark Heart so it's ready to assemble the insides.

## 🧠 Shit That Lived in My Head

- I'm about to give up on dyeing the tights. It doesn't seem to be doing much. How bad would it be to use body paint?
- If people get freaked out looking at a *photo* of me with the contacts, imagine how its going to look in real life? 
- WHERE ARE MY CONTACTS :( I ordered "normal" contacts that I could wear all day and then  swap out for the SFX ones during special events. It says they were delivered Thursday but my mailbox is empty.

## 🔮 Thoughts for Future Work

- Consider if it's worth it to paint pieces separately to avoid masking, or just glue everything together and then mask and paint.

## 📋 TODO — Next Week

- Finish pauldrons
- Sew undergarment corset
- Sew front/back belts

## 📸 Photo Dump

*I put foam clay on the seams so I can sand it in an attempt to hide them.*

*Now that this bad boi is painted, I can figure out how to get the electronics to fit inside. They fit, it's just messy.*

![Box o detail pieces](/assets/images/wth/20260216_box-o-detail-pcs.jpg)
*A long time ago I laser cut all of these pieces and now they are all painted. Some of the pieces have already made their way onto things like the cape and collar. In total, there are over 100 pieces and now they are all painted.*
